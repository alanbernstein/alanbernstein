## Actual Repositories

Isn't it annoying when you check out someone's github profile, and their repos are just a bunch of forks with no updates? Here are some of the repos that I actually use:

Stuff I use actively:
- [quickref](https://github.com/alanbernstein/quickref) - CLI tool to use and manage cheat sheets stored one-topic-per-file, one-note-per-line
- [treemonger](https://github.com/alanbernstein/treemonger) - disk usage visualizer, in the style of spacemonger
- [jumble](https://github.com/alanbernstein/jumble) - "jumble" daily puzzle as a minimal web app
- [fswatch](https://github.com/alanbernstein/fswatch) - simple hack to use org-tables as source content to generate static websites, with "deployment" to shared hosting via FTP
- [svgtools](https://github.com/alanbernstein/svgtools) - tools for working with svg images in python
- [tripinator](https://github.com/alanbernstein/tripinator) - scripts for generating a static photo gallery website, with an inset map showing a GPX track


Working on it:
- [dymaxion](https://github.com/alanbernstein/dymaxion) - I'm trying to build a CNC globe, generating the design files from scratch (or on top of python+numpy, anyway) because that seems easier than trying to find some combination of GIS/CAD tooling that can do what I need. Mathematica might be able to do it all, but I don't have that much need for it, plus I prefer open source options, especially for programming languages.
- [sdf-cad](https://github.com/alanbernstein/sdf-cad) - utilities and projects for 3d printing, using [https://github.com/deadsy/sdfx](sdfx) instead of openscad
- [blog](https://github.com/alanbernstein/blog)


Done:
- [pynrose](https://github.com/alanbernstein/pynrose) - program that procedurally draws a penrose triangle, generalized in several ways
- [pyzzle](https://github.com/alanbernstein/pyzzle) - jigsaw SVG generator
- [weddingbox-video](https://github.com/alanbernstein/weddingbox-video) - basic example of how to create a CG animation of a wooden CNC project using only open-source, programmatic tools


Mostly abandoned:
- [dash](https://github.com/alanbernstein/dash) - simple handler for hacked amazon dash buttons
- [celebutty](https://github.com/alanbernstein/celebutty) - chrome extension to replace annoying celebrity names
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/alanbernstein/dotfiles) - complicated modular system for environment-dependent dotfiles, which i abandoned when i realized i'm pretty happy with using the same dotfiles in all environments, and also that writing software in bash sucks
